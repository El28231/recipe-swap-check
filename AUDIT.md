- ABI schema extraction: PASS
- Pyright contract typecheck: PASS; 0 errors and 0 warnings
- Hardened direct tests: PASS (3/3)
- Five-validator GLSim workflow: PASS
- Live StudioNet deployment, nondeterministic write, execution-success assertion, and persisted-state read: PASS
- Observed StudioNet result: SAFE/FIT
- StudioNet contract address: 0x750f5d2F17EeC9b0FD0D9Eb45e6734f3309369FF
- Pinned dependency consistency: PASS
- Secret scan: PASS; no populated environment values or wallet files
- Workspace semantic and structural duplicate review: PASS

## Manual review

Reviewed state reachability, replay prevention, role checks, input bounds, model-output normalization, validator independence, prompt-injection boundaries, evidence authority, privacy, source freshness, fund custody, and certification claims.

## Findings and residual risk

No known high-, medium-, or submission-blocking defect remains. SAFE means only compatible with the supplied culinary constraints. It is not allergy, toxicology, nutritional, or medical certification. Validator disagreement can leave a transaction unresolved, and third-party review is discretionary; this audit cannot guarantee acceptance.

The concrete runner pin matches the runner documented for GenLayer contract examples. The linter's newer-runner notice is informational; the pinned source passed live StudioNet.
